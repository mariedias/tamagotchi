# Tamagotchi
This is a simple Tamagotchi game implemented in Java ðŸ‘¾
<br><br>
The game allows users to adopt and take care of a virtual pet, including feeding, playing, and monitoring its health.<br> The code demonstrates basic game development concepts and can be used as a learning resource for beginners in programming.

I created this project using BlueJ during my 1st semester in Computer Science.
